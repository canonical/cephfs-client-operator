The CephFS client operator requests and mounts exported Ceph filesystems on virtual machines. Ceph File System (CephFS)
is a POSIX-compliant file system built on top of Ceph‚Äôs distributed object store, RADOS.

## ‚ú® Getting started 

#### With Microceph

1. Deploy microceph, ceph-fs, cephfs-client, and a machine to mount the filesystem on: 

```shell
juju add-model ceph
juju deploy -n 3 microceph \
  --channel latest/edge \
  --storage osd-standalone='2G,3' \
  --constraints="virt-type=virtual-machine root-disk=10G mem=4G"
juju deploy ceph-fs --channel latest/edge
juju deploy cephfs-client data --channel latest/edge --config mountpoint=/data
juju deploy ubuntu --base ubuntu@22.04 --constraints virt-type=virtual-machine
```

2. Integrate everything, and that's it!

```shell
juju integrate microceph:mds ceph-fs:ceph-mds
juju integrate data:cephfs-share ceph-fs:cephfs-share
juju integrate ubuntu:juju-info data:juju-info
```
